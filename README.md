A shared repository for the first project.

Understand the rate of cat and dog adoptions between major metropolitan areas and what animal characteristics are most common for each of those areas.

1. Retrieve data from US Census to identify the 5 largest major metropolitan areas

2. Create a pie chart for each city to show the adoption percentage for cats and dogs and geomap the number of cats to dogs given up for adoption across major metropolitan areas. 

3. Create bar chart comparing the monthly number of cats put up for adoption across the 5 different major cities. 

4. Create bar chart comparing the monthly number of dogs put up for adoption across the 5 different major cities. 

5. Create a line graph showing the monthly trend of cat adoptions over the year, highlighting any peaks or troughs that may indicate seasonal surrender patterns.

6. Create a line graph for dog adoptions over the same period, allowing for comparison to see if certain times of the year affect the adoption rates of dogs differently than cats.

7. Create a series of pie charts for each major city showing the proportion of adopted cats by color, size, or breed. This can reveal if certain characteristics are more favored in specific urban environments.

9. A geomap the cities with the highest adoption rates with specific characteristics (e.g., small vs. large dogs, or color variations). This visualization will pinpoint regional preferences or biases towards certain pet features.
