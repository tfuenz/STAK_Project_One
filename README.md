Understand if more dogs are given up for adoption in the major  metropolitan areas compared to the surrounding suburban areas listed below.  

According to 2022 US Census data, the 5 largest major metropolitan areas are as follows:

Independent Variable 1:  Metropolitan Cities
1. NYC, NY
2. Los Angeles, CA
3. Phoenix, AZ 
4. Chicago, IL 
5. Dallas, TX

Independent Variable 2: Suburban Cities
1. Yonkers, NY
2. Mission Viejo, CA
3. Mesa, AZ
4. Schaumburg, IL
5. Pearland, TX

Before completing the tasks below, pull in Pet Finder API and create a csv file.

Part 1 - Research Questions

Question 1:  Are people who live in metropolitan areas versus the suburbs more likely to put dogs up for adoption? 

1. Create bar chart comparing the number of dogs up for adoption in all major metropolitan and suburban cities identified above. 

2. Produce a map with bubbles sized to illustrate the number of dogs up for adoption in each city.  

3. Create a pie chart for the total amount of dogs up for adoption aggregated in two independent variables, metropolitan and suburban areas. 

Question 2:  Are people living in metropolitan areas compared to suburbs more likely to put large dogs up for adoption?

1. Create a pie chart for each city illustrating the size of dogs up for adoption.

2. Run an independent t-test comparing the dog size for each metropolitan city to the surrounding suburban city.

3. Run an independent t-test for the dog sizes aggregated in two independent variable, metropolitan and suburban areas. 

Question 3:  Are cats less likely to be given up for adoption in metropolitan areas?

1.  Produce a bar graph comparing how many cats and dogs are up for adoption in each metropolitan city.

2.  Create a pie graph comparing how many cats and dogs are up for adoption in each metropolitan city.

Part 2 - Statistical Analysis

1. Perform an independent sample t-test, using a 95% level of confidence, with the two independent variables and determine if the null hypothesis will be rejected or accepted.

2. Find the mean of each variable to support the results of the independent t-test. 

Null Hypothesis: If the number of dogs given up for adoption is not related to urbanization, the total difference in the amount of dogs given up for adoption in metropolitan compared to suburban areas will be 5% or less of each other.

Alternate Hypothesis: If the number of dogs given up for adoption is related to urbanization, the total difference in the amount of dogs given up for adoption in metropolitan compared to suburban areas will be greater than 5% of each other.
